      <p>Canonical tags are essential for managing duplicate content and improving the SEO of your website. They guide search engines to the preferred version of a page, ensuring the correct URL is indexed and ranked.</p>
      <p>For instance, if you have pages with similar or identical content due to dynamic parameters or multiple categories, a canonical tag consolidates the ranking signals to a single URL. This helps avoid penalties for duplicate content.</p>
      <p>Adding canonical tags in React can be done statically for global pages via the <code>public/index.html</code> file or dynamically using tools like <code>react-helmet</code> for individual pages.</p>
      <p>Best practices include always using absolute URLs in canonical tags, testing their implementation with tools like Google Search Console, and ensuring each page has only one canonical tag. By implementing these practices, you can significantly enhance your React app's SEO and ensure consistent performance in search engine rankings.</p>
